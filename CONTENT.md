# [fit] Elixir

_**battle tested & optimized for devs happiness**_

---
![filtered](force.jpg)

I FELT
A GREAT
DISTURBANCE
IN THE FORCE

^ I guess I am an early adopter:) I started with java in the past century! 1998

^ Then in 2005, I found out about Ruby and fell in love.
I have been a happy Ruby developer for 10 years ...

^ But again, I felt a great disturbance in the force.
Suddenly, all the alpha geeks with a beard I was following were all
tweeting about Elixir. So, I started to read books, listen some podcast,
watch some confs, to buys some books. And now, I am very excited about Elixir too: I have started to learn it.
I feel there is a great future coming for this language and Erlang VM.

### Jose Valim

^ This is the CREATOR of Elixir: Jose Valim. He is the one playing the guitar at Euruko 2011 in Berlin where he gave his 1st talk Elixir.
^ He is smart. Super smart.
On top of that, Jose is a really good prompt, always ready to help and teach others. The elixir
community is like him, very friendly and welcoming

- Functional
- Erlang
- Pretty syntax 

^ Elixir in 1 slide;) 
^ Functional: list of buzz words: Pattern matching (awesome), Macros (if
is a macro), Immutability, Pipes, much more to learn!
^ Erlang: as fast as Erlang, can call Erlang functions with no cost.
Battle tested for concurrency and distributed
^ Erlang syntax is not optimized for devs hapiness. Elixir is, it also
looks like Ruby ;)

```elixir
defmodule HelloWorld do
  @doc "Greets by name, or by **"Hello, World!"** `if` no name is given."

  def hello(), do: "Hello, World!"

  def hello(name) do
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
end
```
