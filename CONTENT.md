# [fit] Elixir

_**battle tested & optimized for devs happiness**_

^ Hello / Bonjour! My name is Jean-Michel Garnier,
I have been a ruby developer for the last 10 years. 
Today, my goal is to share my joy and excitement about the Elixir language

I FELT
A GREAT
DISTURBANCE
IN THE FORCE

^ I guess I am an early adopter:) I started with java in the past century! 1998

^ Then in 2005, I found out about Rails. I will make it short, but java
enterprise at the time was so XML XML XML. So I fell in love with Ruby. Since then,
I have been a happy Ruby developer for 10 years ...

^ But again, I felt a great disturbance in the force.
Suddenly, all the alpha geeks with a beard I was following were all
tweeting about Elixir. So, I started to read books, listen some podcast,
watch some confs. And now, I am very excited about Elixir too, I have started to learn it.
I feel there is a great future coming for this language and Erlang VM.

### Jose Valim

^ This is a picture of Jose Valim, the creator of Elixir. He is the one playing the guitar at Euruko 2011 in Berlin.
^ He gave a talk at that conference about the 1st version of Elixir.
^ He is smart. Super smart.
On top of that, Jose is a really good prompt, always ready to help and teach others. The elixir
community is like him, very friendly.
